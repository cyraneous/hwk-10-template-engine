Template Engine - Employee Summary
A Node CLI that takes employee information and generates an HTML summary page

Approach
Breaking down the requirements, I separated out the objective into the following parts:

Define a constructor for the base employee, then extend it into the three employee types
Create html templates for each employee type
Using the command line, prompt the team leader to enter their information
Once the team leader is added, begin adding team members
Using the list of team members, generate the html page containing all members of the team
